# Edit .env with your credentials
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

### 4. Spotify API Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Add redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
4. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret
5. Update `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```env
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
   PLAYLIST_ID=your_playlist_id
   ```

### 5. Get Playlist ID

- Open Spotify and go to your playlist
- Copy the playlist URL: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2NjzrKmSXhOvofpoTEE9UC`
- The playlist ID is the part after `/playlist/`: `2NjzrKmSXhOvofpoTEE9UC`

## Usage

### Basic Download (Complete Workflow)

```bash
# Download playlist with automatic AI filename generation and car audio preparation
python spotdl/main.py

# This automatically:
# 1. Downloads tracks from YouTube
# 2. Generates clean filenames using AI
# 3. Prepares car audio optimized files in CarAudio/ folder
# 4. Avoids re-downloading existing tracks
# 5. Creates both downloads/ and CarAudio/ folders
```

**No separate commands needed** - everything happens in one streamlined process!

### Car Audio Preparation

Car audio preparation is now **completely automatic** with every download:

```bash
# Single command does everything
python spotdl/main.py

# No additional steps needed!
# Car audio files are automatically created in CarAudio/ folder
```

**Automatic Car Audio Features:**

- Creates separate CarAudio/ folder with optimized files
- AI-generated car-friendly filenames
- VW Passat CC compatible ID3v2.3 tags
- FAT32-friendly file naming
- Sequential track numbering

### AI-Powered Workflow (Always-On)

The downloader includes **always-on AI and car audio preparation**:

```bash
# Set up Ollama (one-time setup)
./setup_ollama.sh

# Single command for complete workflow
python spotdl/main.py
```

**Integrated Features (Automatic):**

- **Smart Filenames**: AI generates clean, consistent filenames for every track
- **Car Audio Ready**: Files automatically prepared for VW-compatible systems
- **Dual Output**: Both original and car-optimized files created
- **Fallback Support**: Works without AI if Ollama unavailable

**What Happens Automatically:**

- Downloads tracks with AI-cleaned filenames
- Creates original files in downloads/ folder
- Creates car audio files in CarAudio/ folder
- Prevents re-downloading existing tracks
- Generates VW-compatible ID3v2.3 tags

## VS Code Integration

This project includes comprehensive VS Code tasks for easy development and usage:

```bash

## File Structure

After running the downloader, you'll get:

```
downloads/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Playlist Name - PlaylistID/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01. Artist - Song.mp3            # Original downloads
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02. Artist - Song.mp3
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .download_tracking.json          # Prevents re-downloads
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CarAudio/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Playlist Name/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01 - Song.mp3                 # Car-optimized files
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02 - Song.mp3                 # (AI-cleaned filenames)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Key Points:**

- **downloads/**: Original files with full artist-song names
- **CarAudio/**: Car stereo optimized with simplified names
- **Tracking**: `.download_tracking.json` prevents duplicate downloads
- **AI Filenames**: Both folders use AI-generated clean names

## Car Audio Tips

For optimal car stereo compatibility:

- Format USB stick as **FAT32**
- Use **USB 2.0 stick** (‚â§32GB recommended)
- Copy the entire playlist folder to USB root
- Tested with VW Passat CC and similar systems
