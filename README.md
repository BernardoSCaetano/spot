# Spotify Playlist MP3 Downloader

This project fetches tracks from a Spotify playlist (including private playlists) and downloads the corresponding MP3 files from YouTube. Downloaded files are stored in organized folders with proper metadata for car audio systems and music players.

## Features

- üéµ **Spotify Integration**: Authenticate with Spotify (supports private playlists)
- üì• **Smart Downloads**: Fetch playlist tracks and download MP3s from YouTube
- üìÅ **Auto Organization**: Creates playlist-named folders with numbered tracks
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Filenames**: Uses local Ollama to generate clean, consistent filenames automatically
- üöó **Car Audio Ready**: Prepares files with proper ID3v2.3 metadata for car stereos (automatic)
- üîç **Optimized Search**: Avoids official videos/intros for better audio quality
- üìä **Progress Tracking**: Real-time download progress with success/failure indicators

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/BernardoSCaetano/spot.git
cd spot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up AI features (optional but recommended)
./setup_ollama.sh
```

### 3. Environment Setup

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your credentials
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

### 4. Spotify API Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Add redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
4. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret
5. Update `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```env
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
   PLAYLIST_ID=your_playlist_id
   ```

### 5. Get Playlist ID

- Open Spotify and go to your playlist
- Copy the playlist URL: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2NjzrKmSXhOvofpoTEE9UC`
- The playlist ID is the part after `/playlist/`: `2NjzrKmSXhOvofpoTEE9UC`

## Usage

### Basic Download (Recommended)

```bash
# Download playlist with AI-powered filename generation
python spotdl/main.py

# This automatically:
# 1. Downloads tracks from YouTube
# 2. Generates clean filenames using AI
# 3. Prepares car audio optimized files
# 4. Avoids re-downloading existing tracks
```

### Car Audio Preparation

The integrated workflow automatically prepares files for car audio systems:

```bash
# Basic download (includes AI filename generation)
python spotdl/main.py

# Car audio optimization is automatic with every download
# Files are saved to both downloads/ and CarAudio/ folders

# Manual car audio preparation for existing files
python spotdl/main.py --car-audio "/path/to/playlist/folder"
```

### AI-Powered Workflow (Integrated)

The downloader now includes **always-on AI** for optimal results:

```bash
# Set up Ollama (one-time setup)
./setup_ollama.sh

# Download with automatic AI filename cleaning
python spotdl/main.py

# Car audio preparation with AI metadata optimization
python spotdl/main.py --car-audio
```

**AI Features (Automatic):**

- **Smart Filenames**: AI generates clean, consistent filenames for every track
- **Metadata Standardization**: Artist names, track titles, and album info optimized
- **Car Audio Ready**: Files prepared with VW-compatible ID3v2.3 tags
- **Fallback Support**: Works without AI if Ollama unavailable

**AI Improvements:**
- Standardize artist names (e.g., "Beatles, The" ‚Üí "The Beatles")
- Clean track titles (remove "(Remastered)", version info)
- Fix capitalization and remove problematic characters
- Generate car-friendly filenames automatically

## VS Code Integration

This project includes comprehensive VS Code tasks for easy development and usage:

```bash
# Access via Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P):
# "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí Select from available tasks
```

## File Structure

After running the downloader, you'll get:

```
downloads/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Playlist Name - PlaylistID/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01. Artist - Song.mp3            # Original downloads
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02. Artist - Song.mp3
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .download_tracking.json          # Prevents re-downloads
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CarAudio/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Playlist Name/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01 - Song.mp3                 # Car-optimized files
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02 - Song.mp3                 # (AI-cleaned filenames)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Key Points:**
- **downloads/**: Original files with full artist-song names
- **CarAudio/**: Car stereo optimized with simplified names  
- **Tracking**: `.download_tracking.json` prevents duplicate downloads
- **AI Filenames**: Both folders use AI-generated clean names

## Car Audio Tips

For optimal car stereo compatibility:

- Format USB stick as **FAT32**
- Use **USB 2.0 stick** (‚â§32GB recommended)
- Copy the entire playlist folder to USB root
- Tested with VW Passat CC and similar systems

## Requirements
